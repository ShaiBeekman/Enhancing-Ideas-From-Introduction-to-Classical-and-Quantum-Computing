    }//all this because left qubit is the control qubit, and the right qubit is the target qubit, this is all the information i have about this currently. My intuition is that the control qubit is intended to affect the target qubit, which is why I have coded this as such. I will find out more about whether my code is how this structure is intended to operate as I read further

        /*notice s3 and s4 are inverses of each other*/
            //this could be used for a time reversal operation, or action reversal operation
                //meaning storage needs to be implemented, so that when multiple words can be used an author can include the multiplel possibly word choices in a word box, this could make reading more accurate and fulfilling. For example, I would like to say both "used for a" and also "used to impelement a" on l16 for 100% accuracy. So I have to make this possible with some kind of word-box to store both pieces of information. Of course, this is for any line or word that you would like to implement multiple meanings toward.
